                        <p>Hello! Thank you for taking time to  look at my website – it's for women  seeking joy and strength in day to day life.  My life, like yours, 
                        has been full of ups and downs.  I have at times, chosen not to follow God. Yet He still loved me, and saved me.  
                        My blessings include a loving family, good friends, and a church home that fits.  I don’t have all the answers, but I’m willing to share my experiences,
                         my mistakes, and my successes to let you know through Christ, we can all have grace - under fire and after fire. </p>

                        <h2>A little about me</h2>
                        <p>Most importantly, I believe in God the Father and I believe in Jesus Christ. I am also a wife, a mother, and a grandmother.  
                            I had a 35 year career in law enforcement  where I've encountered people during the worst of circumstances: A school shooting with six teenagers shot, with five of them killed, 
                            A mud slide destroying a community with 43 lives lost, An 18 month old little girl who drowned in the river, Children assaulted by their own parents, But through God's Grace I was able to witness incredible strength and faith in the people who became part of my life.</p>
